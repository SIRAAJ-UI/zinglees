        <h5>THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT ASSESSMENTS</h5>
        <p>
          The current assessment process favors rote learning and focuses mostly on memory evaluation
          through a series of periodic tests. We believe that the current educational system is missing out
          on the true purpose of assessments. These assessments are done to provide a deep insight into
          the learning that the child has achieved. They are only meaningful if the school can evaluate the
          needs, strengths, and weaknesses of each child to give them the personalized attention that
          they truly deserve!
          The traditional assessment process has become redundant and is not relevant according to the
          needs of children as well. Through our efforts, we aim at revamping the assessment process to
          give each child the chance to thrive and become successful future leaders of tomorrow.

        <h5>MAINTAINING EXCELLENT QUALITY THROUGH PERSONALIZED INSIGHTS</h5>
        <p>
          With this rapidly evolving educational environment, assessing only based on memory retention
          is not a good approach. Analyzing their ability to learn and to apply learned methodologies and
          techniques is extremely important to maintain a global standard quality of education.
          To reach maximum efficiency and perfection for the next generation of future leaders, we must
          take a thorough look inwards and diagnose where we are at this point. ZINGLEES was founded to
          meet the evaluation and assessment needs of the Indian School niche. We work hand in hand
          with both schools and parents to revamp the evaluation process.

                A large portion of schools finds it difficult to achieve their set goals
                and statistics show that this is primarily due to a mere formal assessment practice that we have in
                place
                today. Other than inadequate assessments, there could also be a variety of reasons for schools to fail
                their
                targets and goals. With our help, schools can identify, pinpoint, and resolve each hurdle to ensure that
                they reach all set targets with ease.

            <p>While teaching can be inclusive, Learning is exclusive. Learning varies from student to student based

            <p>Understanding the understanding of every student is the first key step to ensure learning for every
              child in every class. We at ZingLEES by associating with schools as evaluation partners, through our
              purposeful and mindful evaluation process will help schools and teachers have detailed insights of the
              student’s strengths, needs, weakness, struggle patterns, understanding levels in every subject in

            <p>Understanding the limitations of the schools and the teachers and break away from the monotonous
              assessment formality which focuses on testing just the rote memory and to support the schools,
              ZingLEES’s services will squarely meet the expectations set by NEP 2020 in assessing the learning of
              every child. This will also help the schools in scoring better grades in the SEQI assessment for

            The primary goal of each parent is to ensure that their children are equipped with the necessary skills to
            be able to conquer any future challenges and hurdles with ease. However, when it comes to monitoring their
            child’s education, they leave it solely up to the schools to ensure that their children are successful.
            Parents depend on test results and notifications from the schools as key identifiers about their child’s
            performance.
            The current reports about the performance do not give proper insight into the strengths, needs, weaknesses,
            and problem areas of the child. Thus parents are not able to intervene when their child needs them the most.
