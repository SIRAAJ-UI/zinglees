            <h5>THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT ASSESSMENTS</h5>
            <p>
              The current assessment process favors rote learning and focuses mostly on memory evaluation
              through a series of periodic tests. We believe that the current educational system is missing out
              on the true purpose of assessments. These assessments are done to provide a deep insight into
              the learning that the child has achieved. They are only meaningful if the school can evaluate the
              needs, strengths, and weaknesses of each child to give them the personalized attention that
              they truly deserve!
              The traditional assessment process has become redundant and is not relevant according to the
              needs of children as well. Through our efforts, we aim at revamping the assessment process to
              give each child the chance to thrive and become successful future leaders of tomorrow.

            <h5>MAINTAINING EXCELLENT QUALITY THROUGH PERSONALIZED INSIGHTS</h5>
            <p>
              With this rapidly evolving educational environment, assessing only based on memory retention
              is not a good approach. Analyzing their ability to learn and to apply learned methodologies and
              techniques is extremely important to maintain a global standard quality of education.
              To reach maximum efficiency and perfection for the next generation of future leaders, we must
              take a thorough look inwards and diagnose where we are at this point. ZINGLEES was founded to
              meet the evaluation and assessment needs of the Indian School niche. We work hand in hand
              with both schools and parents to revamp the evaluation process.

              A large portion of schools finds it difficult to achieve their set goals
            and statistics show that this is primarily due to a mere formal assessment practice that we have in place
            today. Other than inadequate assessments, there could also be a variety of reasons for schools to fail their
            targets and goals. With our help, schools can identify, pinpoint, and resolve each hurdle to ensure that
            they reach all set targets with ease.
